= TopTen - Find The Top Ten Words in a Text File

Here you can find a short Java programm to find the ten most used words
in a given text file. This programm is used by me to compare the features
of the https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM^] with other JVM implementations.

The program was written by Chris Seaton and can be found
https://github.com/chrisseaton/graalvm-ten-things.

== Running as JMH benchmark

The JMH framework is used to gather performance information
by running the the underlying algorithm as JMH benchmark.


Steps to run the benchmark:

1. Build the required text files by executing the following commands:
   `make large.txt` and `make small.txt`.
2. Set `JAVA_HOME` to the installation directory of the JDK you
   would like to use.
3. Run the benchmark by executing `$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar target/benchmarks.jar`.
